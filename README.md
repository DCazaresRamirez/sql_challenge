# sql_challenge
In this challenge we were focusing on 3 different aspects
- creating a "thinking map" with the Entity Relationship Diagram
- Building up our table schemata with the correct data types, primary keys, as well as foreign keys
- creating a sql save with all the queries requested based on our created tables and csv imports

  Challenges:
  - Took a few back and forth data type changes on both the ERD as well as the schemata sql typing since I had to look at all the csv files to ensure that the data types I was using were in the correct format.
  - It also took some back and forth on the Schemata importing of csv's because I was trying to get done so fast that I forgot to read the very hint that was in the assigment itself which was to import in the same order in which you create the tables due to the foreign key constraints.
  - The queries themselves weren't too bad but had a bit of experimenting to get the joins down to visualize all data when looking at multiple tables.
 
  Seemed like a very simple assigment but I hadn't done this sql in quite some time so it took some going over notes to refresh the mind on these things.
